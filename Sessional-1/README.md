Create a mongoose schema naming students and courses. Students will have fields like name, age, year, email, phone number, course enrolled etc.

Courses will have fields like department, name, credit hours, subject Outline etc.
You will create a node server and 
1) Create a schema for students and courses and create reference of courses in Students.

    
2) Make a mongoose model

3) Write a route to Insert a course in course model and add that course ID to all students in a specific yearin student model.

4) Write a route to Search all the courses from the course collection where credit hours are greater than equal to 3 and the department is “IT”.

## Second Part:
Just write a query (No Route) using an aggregate pipeline, which isto fetch all the courses with students.
